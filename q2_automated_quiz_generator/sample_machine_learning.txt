    Introduction to Machine Learning
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    
    1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data. The model learns to map input features to known output labels. Examples include classification and regression problems.
    
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common unsupervised learning tasks.
    
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve maximum cumulative reward.
    
    Key Concepts:
    
    - Features: The input variables used to make predictions
    - Labels: The output variables we want to predict
    - Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
    - Testing Data: The dataset used to evaluate model performance
    - Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
    - Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns
    
    Common Algorithms:
    
    - Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous values
    - Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification
    - Decision Trees: Tree-like model for classification and regression
    - Random Forest: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
    - Support Vector Machines: Effective for classification tasks
    - Neural Networks: Deep learning models for complex patterns
    
    Model Evaluation:
    
    - Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
    - Precision: True positives divided by total predicted positives
    - Recall: True positives divided by total actual positives
    - F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
    - Mean Squared Error: Average squared difference between predictions and actual values
    
    Applications:
    
    Machine learning is used in various fields including:
    - Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
    - Finance: Fraud detection and risk assessment
    - Marketing: Customer segmentation and recommendation systems
    - Transportation: Autonomous vehicles and route optimization
    - Entertainment: Content recommendation and gaming AI
